# 🌱 Multiple Disease Detection System with Streamlit Interface

# 🚀 Overview
Welcome to the **Multiple Disease Detection System**, a sophisticated machine learning tool for identifying plant diseases from leaf images. With an intuitive **Streamlit-powered interface**, this project offers instant disease detection, making it a powerful resource for researchers, agronomists, and environmentalists.

🌿 **Why This Project?**  
Diseases in plants can devastate crops, reduce food security, and impact economies. This system bridges the gap by offering a reliable, scalable solution for **quickly diagnosing multiple diseases** directly from image inputs, helping prevent outbreaks and promoting healthy crop management.

# 🔍 Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit, allowing for easy interaction and image uploading.
- **Advanced Image Processing**: Uses Otsu's thresholding and Gaussian filtering to enhance accuracy.
- **Robust Model Architecture**: Utilizes Gradient Boosting, ensuring high performance across multiple disease classes.
- **Real-Time Results**: Processes and classifies images within seconds.

# 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Streamlit** for the front-end interface.
- **OpenCV** and **scikit-image** for image pre-processing (Otsu’s thresholding and Gaussian filtering).
- **scikit-learn** for Gradient Boosting and additional ML techniques.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch** (optional, if needed for deep learning models).
